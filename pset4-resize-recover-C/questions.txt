0.  JPEG - 24 bits per pixel, so 2^24 = 16,777,216 millions colors;
            for grayscale 8 bits, so 256 colors.
    BMP - from 2 to 2^64. 2^24 (16.8 mln) are common.
    GIF - 8 bits per pixel, so 256 colors.
    PNG - 8, 24, or 48 bits per pixel, so 256, 16.8 mln, or 2.8 x 10^14 colors.
            Grayscale 2, 4, 16, or 256 colors.

1.  GIF
2.  With lossless compression, every bit of data can be recovered, 
while in lossy compression some information is permanantly lost.
3.  JPEG
4.  The metadata that is pointing to the actual data is erased, and the space
is moved to a "free" list, while the data stay intact until overwritten.  
5.  Use sanitazation tools, overwrite data with certain known to work patterns,
physically destroy disks.
6.  stdint.h is a header that declares set of integer types of certain sizes,
and defines corresponding macros. 
7.  To set an int of a certain size independently of the machine.
8.  BYTE - 1 byte, WORD - 2, DWORD - 4, LONG - 4
9.  BM
10. bfSize is a size in bytes of the bitmap file, and biSize - 
the size of the bitmapinfoheader.
11. It means the bitmap is top-down, so it starts in the top left
12. biBitCount
13. if there is an error of some sort
14. Because the fread reads chunk of bytes 1 time.
15. 3
16. Skips over the chunk of bytes and positions the stream there. 
17. Indicates that fseek should skip over from the CURrent position of the stream.
